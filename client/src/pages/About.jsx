              Pedophilia is fundamentally wrong and must not be supported for several critical reasons:
              Harm to Victims: Children are vulnerable and incapable of giving informed consent to any sexual activity.
              Engaging in or supporting such actions causes profound psychological, emotional, and physical harm to the victims.
              It can lead to lifelong trauma, mental health issues, and difficulties in forming healthy relationships.
            </p>

            <p>
            Violation of Rights: Children have the right to safety, protection, and a childhood free from sexual exploitation and abuse. 
            Pedophilia violates these fundamental rights and undermines the principles of human dignity and respect.
